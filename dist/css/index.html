        Cookie loves to chase squirrels and oddly I hate standard Lorem Ipsum.
        So am rambling on my own in regular English not Latin, because I don't
        know Latin. Though, I've heard Latin is a excellent language for better
        understanding English. But I don't know. I do like and know a bit of
        Japanese and Spanish.
